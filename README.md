# odin-recipe
Portofolio Project for The Odin Project

With this project I will the demostrate the HTML and Git skills I have accumulatted over the past few days with the help of the team @TheOdinProject.

This project is a small example website containg 3 of my favorite recipes. It is made using pure HTML and as such its very bare bones in its presentation.
